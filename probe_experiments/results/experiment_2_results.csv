0,1,Anxiety,"For the last few months, I’ve been feeling really anxious whenever I leave the house. I can’t stop thinking about all the possible things that could hurt me when I’m out in public. Loads of people are getting stabbed in the area I live in, and I keep thinking what if I’m next? My heart races the moment I leave the house and I’m on high alert the entire time I’m outside. This makes meeting my friends really difficult as I’m unable to enjoy myself because of how anxious I am.","Based on the passage provided, here are three types of information I would try to gather from the client before addressing their issue, ranked in order of priority:

1. **Current safety and coping mechanisms**
Prompting Questions:
- ""How have you been managing your anxiety when you're out in public? Are there any specific strategies that help you feel safer or more in control?""
- ""Have you noticed any situations or triggers that make your anxiety worse or better?""
- ""Are there any people or resources that you rely on for support when you're feeling anxious?""

Understanding the client's current coping mechanisms and support system is crucial to ensure their immediate safety and well-being.

2. **History and development of the anxiety**
Prompting Questions:
- ""Can you tell me more about when these anxious thoughts and feelings started? Was there a specific incident or event that triggered them?""
- ""How have your anxiety symptoms changed over time? Have they gotten worse, better, or stayed the same?""
- ""Have you experienced anxiety or other mental health issues in the past? If so, how did you manage them?""

Gathering information about the history and development of the anxiety can help identify potential underlying causes and patterns.

3. **Impact on daily life and relationships**
Prompting Questions:
- ""How has your anxiety affected your relationships with friends and family? Are there any specific challenges or conflicts that have arisen?""
- ""Have you noticed any changes in your daily routine or activities due to your anxiety? Are there things you used to enjoy that you've had to give up?""
- ""How do you think your anxiety has impacted your overall quality of life? Are there any specific goals or activities that you'd like to be able to do but feel held back by your anxiety?""

Understanding the impact of the anxiety on the client's daily life and relationships can help identify areas of focus for treatment and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue.","Here’s how I would structure the information-gathering process as a therapist, ranked by priority:  

1. **Safety and Risk Assessment** *(Most urgent—need to rule out immediate danger or severe impairment)*  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - ""You mentioned worrying about being harmed in public. Have these fears ever led to thoughts of harming yourself or others?""  
   - ""How much is this anxiety interfering with basic needs, like leaving the house for work, groceries, or medical care?""  
   - ""Do you feel safe where you live, or have you experienced direct threats?""  

2. **Duration, Severity, and Triggers** *(Key to understanding the clinical picture)*  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - ""You said this has been happening for months—has the anxiety gotten worse over time, or does it fluctuate?""  
   - ""Can you describe a recent time when the anxiety was at its worst? What was happening around you?""  
   - ""Are there specific situations (e.g., crowded places, nighttime) that make it harder?""  

3. **Coping Strategies and Support Systems** *(Assessing resilience and resources)*  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - ""What have you tried so far to manage the anxiety when you’re outside? Does anything help even a little?""  
   - ""You mentioned friends—are there people you feel safer with when you’re out? Who supports you in this?""  
   - ""Have you ever talked to a doctor or therapist about this before? If so, what was helpful or unhelpful?""  

**Rationale for Order:**  
1. Safety comes first—if the client is avoiding essentials (e.g., food, work) or has suicidal ideation, that requires immediate intervention.  
2. Understanding patterns helps differentiate generalized anxiety, trauma responses, or phobias.  
3. Coping and support reveal strengths to build on in treatment (e.g., exposure therapy, social support).  

*Example follow-up based on their passage:*  
*""It sounds like your anxiety is especially tied to fears of violence. Have you ever been directly exposed to an incident, or is this based on news/stories you’ve heard?""* (This probes whether trauma is a factor.)","1. Type of information: Severity and functional impact of the anxiety  
Prompting Questions:

- ""Can you tell me more about how this anxiety is affecting your daily life? For example, are there specific activities you've stopped doing because of it?""
- ""How often are you leaving the house these days? What helps you decide whether you’ll go out or stay home?""
- ""Is this anxiety interfering with your work, school, or relationships in any significant way?""

2. Type of information: Onset and history of the symptoms  
Prompting Questions:

- ""When did you first start feeling this way about leaving the house? Was there a specific event or situation that triggered it?""
- ""Have you experienced similar feelings of anxiety in the past, or is this a new experience for you?""
- ""Has anything in your life changed recently that might be contributing to these feelings?""

3. Type of information: Safety concerns and perception versus reality of threat  
Prompting Questions:

- ""You mentioned concerns about local stabbings—can you tell me more about what makes you feel specifically at risk?""
- ""Where do you usually get information about what’s happening in your neighborhood? Do you feel this information has influenced your anxiety?""
- ""Do you feel that others around you are just as concerned about personal safety, or do you think your reaction is stronger than most?""

These questions help build a comprehensive understanding of the client's emotional state, underlying beliefs, and environmental factors influencing their anxiety so effective support and treatment planning can be provided.","# Information Needed Before Addressing Anxiety About Public Safety

1. Duration, frequency, and intensity of the anxiety symptoms
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""You mentioned feeling anxious for the last few months. Can you tell me when you first noticed these feelings and how they've changed over time? On a scale of 1-10, how would you rate your anxiety when you're outside? How often during the week do you experience these intense feelings of anxiety? Are there certain times of day or specific situations when your anxiety is better or worse?""

2. Impact on daily functioning and coping strategies attempted
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""I'd like to understand how this anxiety is affecting your daily life. Besides difficulty meeting friends, are there other activities or responsibilities you've been avoiding or finding difficult? What strategies have you tried so far to manage these feelings? Have any of them been helpful, even temporarily? What happens when you try to push through the anxiety and go out anyway?""

3. History of trauma, previous mental health issues, and environmental factors
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""I'm curious about whether you've had any personal experiences with violence or if you've witnessed anything traumatic that might be connected to these fears. Have you experienced anxiety like this before in your life? What's your understanding of the actual crime rates in your area - has there been a recent increase in incidents, or have you been exposed to more news about them? Have there been any other significant changes or stresses in your life during this time period?"""
1,2,Anxiety,"I’m a contractor and I go to multiple different offices throughout the week. Recently, I started having a really strange reaction whenever I go to one of my offices. My chest gets really tight, I feel like something really bad is about to happen and sometimes I even have trouble breathing. I’m still doing the work for that company, but I’ve stopped going to the office. It pays really well, but now the company is annoyed with me for always having to meet somewhere else and I’m feeling anxious even just thinking about talking to them.","Based on the passage provided, here are the three types of information I would try to gather from the client before addressing their issue, ranked in order of priority:

1. **Nature and severity of the symptoms**
Prompting Questions:
- Can you describe in more detail what happens when you experience this tightness in your chest? 
- How long have you been experiencing these symptoms, and have they worsened over time? 
- Have you ever experienced these symptoms in other situations or environments outside of this specific office?

2. **Triggering factors and office environment**
Prompting Questions:
- Can you tell me more about this specific office that seems to trigger your symptoms? 
- Is there something in particular that you associate with this office, such as a person, a memory, or a specific task? 
- Have there been any significant changes or events in your life around the time you started experiencing these symptoms?

3. **Client's coping mechanisms and support system**
Prompting Questions:
- How have you been managing these symptoms so far, and what strategies have you found helpful or unhelpful? 
- Do you have a support system in place, such as friends, family, or colleagues, who are aware of your struggles? 
- Have you considered seeking help or talking to someone about these symptoms before, and what motivated you to seek help now?

These questions would help me better understand the client's symptoms, identify potential triggers, and assess their current coping mechanisms and support system, ultimately informing a more effective treatment plan.","Here’s how I would prioritize and gather information as a therapist, based on the passage:  

1. **Nature and Triggers of the Symptoms**  
   *Priority*: Understanding the specific symptoms, their intensity, and potential triggers is critical to assess whether this is anxiety, panic, or another issue (e.g., trauma response).  
   *Prompting Questions*:  
   - ""You mentioned your chest gets tight and you feel like something bad will happen. Can you describe what that feels like in more detail? How long does it usually last?""  
   - ""Is there anything specific about *that* office—like sounds, smells, people, or past experiences—that seems to trigger these reactions?""  
   - ""Do these feelings happen anywhere else, or only in that particular office?""  

2. **Impact on Functioning and Coping Strategies**  
   *Priority*: Gauging how this is affecting the client’s work, relationships, and daily life helps clarify the severity and their current coping mechanisms.  
   *Prompting Questions*:  
   - ""You’ve stopped going to the office—how has that affected your work or your relationship with the company? Are there other areas of your life where this is causing problems?""  
   - ""What have you tried so far to manage these feelings when they come up? Does anything help, even temporarily?""  
   - ""How is your anxiety about talking to the company showing up? For example, are you avoiding calls, or does it affect sleep?""  

3. **Relevant History and Context**  
   *Priority*: Exploring past mental health history, stressors, or traumas can reveal patterns or underlying causes (e.g., past workplace conflict, generalized anxiety).  
   *Prompting Questions*:  
   - ""Have you ever felt like this before, even in a different situation? For example, in other workplaces or during stressful times?""  
   - ""Is there anything else going on in your life right now—stressors, changes, or past experiences—that might be contributing to this?""  
   - ""Have you ever sought help for anxiety or similar issues before?""  

This approach balances urgency (e.g., ruling out panic attacks or acute stress) with building a broader understanding of the client’s context to guide interventions.","1. Type of information: Detailed description and history of symptoms  
Prompting Questions:

- “Can you tell me more about when these symptoms started? Was there anything unusual or stressful happening in your life around that time?”
- “How often do you experience these symptoms? Are they limited to this one office, or have you noticed them occurring in other settings as well?”
- “What exactly happens when you go to that office — can you walk me through what you’re feeling physically and emotionally before, during, and after?”

Understanding the onset, frequency, and specificity of the symptoms is critical to assessing whether the reaction could be a form of situational anxiety, panic attacks, or trauma-related response. It helps in making an accurate clinical impression and guiding treatment direction.

2. Type of information: Possible triggers and associations  
Prompting Questions:

- “Is there anything specific about that particular office — people, location, past experiences — that you think might be contributing to how you feel?”
- “Have you had a difficult or negative experience in that environment that might be related to your current reaction?”
- “Have you ever felt this way before in a different setting or situation?”

Identifying environmental or interpersonal triggers can help assess whether the client is experiencing a conditioned response or if the situation taps into unresolved emotional trauma or conflict. This is vital for developing an effective coping or exposure strategy.

3. Type of information: Impact on functioning and coping strategies  
Prompting Questions:

- “How is this issue affecting your ability to work and manage your responsibilities overall?”
- “What have you tried so far to cope with the anxiety you're experiencing? Has anything helped or made it worse?”
- “Who have you talked to about this, if anyone, and what kind of support do you have right now?”

Understanding the impact of the anxiety on the client’s work and general life, as well as their current coping mechanisms and support system, provides important context for how urgently the issue needs intervention and what types of supports or strategies might be most feasible and effective.","# Assessment Information Needed

1. Specific Triggers and Context
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""Can you walk me through what happens before, during, and after these episodes at this particular office? Are there specific situations, people, or physical aspects of that environment that seem to precede these feelings? Have you noticed any patterns about when these symptoms are most intense or when they might be less severe?""

2. Symptom History and Development
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""When did you first notice these reactions? Have you ever experienced similar symptoms in other settings or at other times in your life? How have these symptoms progressed over time - are they getting better, worse, or staying about the same? Have you tried any strategies to manage these feelings, and if so, how effective were they?""

3. Impact on Functioning and Safety Assessment
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""How is this situation affecting your overall wellbeing, work performance, and relationships? Are you experiencing any thoughts of harming yourself when these symptoms occur? Besides avoiding the office, have you noticed other changes in your behavior or daily routine because of this situation? What support systems do you currently have in place?"""
2,3,Depression,"For the last few months, I’ve been struggling to motivate myself to do anything. I’ve been unemployed for 6 months, and have become more and more isolated in that time. I don’t want to feel like this but I also don’t feel interested in doing anything. I don’t care about hanging out with friends or seeing family, and I don’t care about doing nice things for myself. I don’t care about anything.","Based on the passage provided, here are three types of information I would try to gather from the client, ranked in order of priority:

1. **Current Safety and Well-being**
Prompting Questions:
- ""Can you tell me a little bit more about your daily routine and how you've been taking care of yourself physically and emotionally during this time?""
- ""Have you noticed any changes in your appetite, sleep patterns, or overall health?""
- ""Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others, or have you felt overwhelmed to the point of not knowing how to cope?""

This information is crucial to gather first, as it helps assess the client's immediate safety and well-being. It's essential to ensure the client is not at risk of harming themselves or others and to identify any potential health concerns that may be contributing to their mental health issue.

2. **History and Development of the Issue**
Prompting Questions:
- ""You mentioned you've been feeling this way for the last few months, but can you think back to when you first started noticing these feelings of apathy and disinterest? Was there a specific event or situation that triggered this?""
- ""How did you cope with stress and difficult emotions before you became unemployed, and have you noticed any changes in your coping mechanisms since then?""
- ""Have you experienced any significant life events or stressors during the past six months that may be contributing to your current state?""

Prompting Questions:
- ""Have you tried anything so far to address these feelings of apathy and disinterest, such as talking to friends or family, trying new activities, or seeking professional help?""
- ""What do you think has been the most challenging part of trying to overcome these feelings, and what do you think would need to happen for you to start feeling more motivated and engaged?""
- ""Are there any specific goals or outcomes you hope to achieve through therapy, and what do you think would be the most important steps in getting there?""

Gathering information about previous attempts at addressing the issue can help identify what has and hasn't worked, what the client is willing to try, and what their expectations are for therapy. This information can inform the development of a treatment plan that is tailored to the client's specific needs and goals.","Here’s how I would structure the information gathering as a therapist, ranked by priority:

My house is a mess and my friends keep saying they’re worried about me, but honestly nothing is wrong. I don’t feel sad or upset or anything really. I’m just so fucking tired all the time. I don’t even want to play video games anymore. It’s getting harder to make myself go to work, but there’s nothing wrong with my job either. I don’t get it.","Based on the passage provided, here are three types of information I would try to gather from the client, ranked in order of priority:

1. **Safety and Immediate Risks**
Prompting Questions:
- ""Can you tell me more about what you mean by 'it's getting harder to make myself go to work'? Have you missed any days or had trouble completing tasks?""
- ""Are you taking care of your basic needs, such as eating and hygiene?""
- ""Have you ever thought about harming yourself or others, or felt like you're in crisis?""

This information is crucial to assess the client's immediate safety and potential risks, such as suicidal ideation or severe impairment in daily functioning.

2. **Pattern and History of Symptoms**
Prompting Questions:
- ""When did you first notice this increase in sleepiness and lack of motivation? Was it sudden or gradual?""
- ""Have you experienced any similar periods in your life before? If so, what happened during those times?""
- ""Are there any specific situations or events that seem to trigger or worsen your symptoms?""

Prompting Questions:
- ""What do you usually do to cope with stress or difficult emotions? Have you tried anything to address your current symptoms?""
- ""You mentioned your friends are worried about you. How do you feel about their concerns, and have you talked to them about what you're experiencing?""
- ""Are there any other people in your life who you feel comfortable talking to about your struggles, such as family members or a partner?""

Gathering information about the client's coping mechanisms and support system can help identify potential strengths and resources that can be leveraged in treatment, as well as areas where additional support may be needed.","Here’s how I would structure the information-gathering process as a therapist, ranked by priority:  

1. **Current Symptoms and Duration**  
   *Why?* Understanding the specifics of the client’s symptoms (e.g., fatigue, anhedonia, sleep changes) and how long they’ve been occurring helps differentiate between potential causes (e.g., depression, medical issues, burnout).  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - *""You mentioned feeling tired all the time—can you describe how long this has been going on? Weeks? Months?""*  
   - *""When you say you don’t feel anything, does that include a lack of enjoyment in things you usually like, such as video games?""*  
   - *""How has your sleep been? Are you sleeping more than usual, or struggling to stay awake during the day?""*  

2. **Psychosocial Context and Stressors**  
   *Why?* Even if the client denies overt sadness, external factors (e.g., work pressure, isolation, unresolved stress) could contribute to their fatigue and apathy.  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - *""You said nothing’s wrong with your job, but has anything felt overwhelming or unfulfilling lately, even in small ways?""*  
   - *""How connected do you feel to your friends/family right now? You mentioned they’re worried—has anything changed in those relationships?""*  
   - *""When you’re not working or sleeping, how do you usually spend your time? Has that changed recently?""*  

3. **Physical Health and Lifestyle Factors**  
   *Why*: Excessive fatigue and disengagement can stem from medical conditions (e.g., thyroid issues, anemia) or habits (e.g., diet, exercise, substance use). Ruling these out is key.  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - *""Have you had any recent check-ups or blood work done? Fatigue like this can sometimes relate to physical health.""*  
   - *""How’s your appetite been? Have you noticed weight changes or shifts in energy after eating?""*  
   - *""Do you use caffeine, alcohol, or other substances to cope with fatigue? If so, how much?""*  

**Rationale for Order**:  
1. Symptoms clarify the clinical picture.  
2. Context reveals potential triggers or maintaining factors.  
3. Physical health ensures no oversight of treatable medical contributors.  

**Note**: If the client disclosed suicidal ideation or severe impairment (e.g., inability to work), safety would become the top priority. Here, their presentation suggests dysthymia or atypical depression, but thorough assessment is needed.","1. Type of information: Duration and Onset of Symptoms  
Prompting Questions:  
- “When did you first start noticing these changes in your energy levels and motivation?”  
- “Has there been a specific event or time period that seemed to trigger this shift for you?”  
- “Have your sleep patterns, energy levels, or motivation fluctuated like this before in the past?”

Understanding how long this has been happening and whether it developed suddenly, gradually, or in response to something specific is essential for differential diagnosis and treatment planning.

2. Type of information: Impact on Functioning and Daily Life  
Prompting Questions:  
- “How have these changes affected your ability to do everyday tasks like work, cooking, or taking care of your home?”  
- “Are you missing more days at work or finding it harder to show up on time?”  
- “What does a typical day look like for you right now compared to a few months ago?”

This helps assess the severity of the impairment and understand how significantly the client’s quality of life is being affected, which can be critical for diagnosing disorders like depression or burnout.

3. Type of information: Emotional and Cognitive Experience  
Prompting Questions:  
- “Even though you mentioned not feeling sad or upset, are there moments where you do notice any emotions—like emptiness, irritability, or anxiety?”  
- “Have you been feeling numb or disconnected from things that used to matter to you?”  
- “How have your thoughts about yourself or your life changed recently?”

Although the client denies feeling sad, exploring subtler emotional or cognitive shifts can reveal important clues about possible underlying conditions like atypical depression or dysthymia, where the emotional experience might not present in the ‘classic’ ways.","# Information Needed Before Addressing Client's Issue

1. ### Duration and pattern of symptoms
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""When did you first notice this change in your energy levels and sleep patterns?""
   ""Has this happened before in your life, or is this the first time you've experienced this level of fatigue?""
   ""Have you noticed any pattern to when you feel more or less tired, or is it constant?""

2. ### Physical health assessment
   **Prompting Questions:**
   ""Have you spoken with a medical doctor about these symptoms?""
   ""Have there been any other physical changes you've noticed alongside the fatigue - changes in appetite, weight, or pain anywhere?""

   - ""How would you rate your stress level right now, on a scale of 1-10?""
   - ""You mentioned feeling like you're close to snapping. Can you tell me more about what you mean by that? What do you think might happen if you 'snap'?""
   - ""Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others when you feel overwhelmed?""

Understanding the client's current emotional state and potential risks is crucial to ensure their safety and well-being. This information will help me determine if the client requires immediate crisis intervention or if we can proceed with a more general therapeutic approach.

2. **Coping mechanisms and support systems**
Prompting Questions:
   - ""How have you been managing your stress so far? Are there any coping strategies that have worked for you in the past?""
   - ""Do you have a support system in place, such as friends, family, or a partner? How do they help you deal with stress?""
   - ""Are there any self-care activities that you enjoy or find relaxing?""

This information will help me understand the client's current coping mechanisms and identify potential areas for improvement. It will also allow me to assess the client's social support network and determine if they need additional resources or referrals.

Prompting Questions:
   - ""Can you tell me more about your work environment and the specific stressors you're facing? Are there any particular tasks or situations that trigger your stress?""
   - ""Have you talked to your supervisor or HR department about your workload and stress levels? Are there any potential solutions or accommodations that could be made?""
   - ""Are there any changes you'd like to see in your work environment or job responsibilities that might help alleviate some of the stress?""

Understanding the specific work-related stressors and potential solutions will help me identify areas where the client may need support or advocacy. This information will also allow me to explore potential problem-solving strategies and coping techniques tailored to the client's work environment.","Here’s how I would approach gathering information as a therapist, prioritizing the most critical details first:

5,6,Stress,"I’m feeling super overwhelmed. My wife just started a new job, but we’re pregnant and we don’t know if she’s going to risk her standing with the company if she takes maternity leave so early and with a baby on the way, we really need the two incomes. I already have a high pressure job, and I started working a lot of overtime so I can hopefully get a promotion before the baby comes. So I always get home really late, barely spend any time with her and can’t help out with the house like I used to. I’m getting really bad headaches sometimes and the only thing that helps is a cigarette, but we both promised to quit for the baby.","Based on the passage, here are three types of information I would try to get from the client before addressing their issue, ranked in order of priority:

1. **Current coping mechanisms and potential risk factors**

   - ""Have you noticed any other physical or emotional symptoms besides headaches that might be related to your stress levels?""

   - *Prompting Questions:*  
     - ""You mentioned headaches and using cigarettes to cope—have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or others due to the stress?""  
     - ""How are you managing the physical symptoms (like headaches)? Are they ever so severe that you feel you need medical attention?""

   - *Prompting Questions:*  
     - ""You’re juggling a lot right now—what helps you get through the day, even in small ways?""

1. **Emotional and Psychological Impact of Past Trauma**

   *Prompting Questions*:  
   - ""You mentioned your ex-husband was abusive—how does that experience still show up for you in your current relationship?""  
   - ""When you think about moving in with your boyfriend, what specific fears or concerns come up for you?""  
   - ""How does your body or emotions react when you imagine sharing a home with him?""  

2. **Current Relationship Dynamics and Communication**

   - ""What does ‘trust’ mean to you in this relationship, and how does that differ from his perspective?""  
   - ""Have you shared with him *why* you’re not ready, or does he assume it’s about trust?""

1. **Current emotional state and motivations**
Prompting Questions:
- Can you tell me more about what's been going through your mind lately when you think about applying to grad programs? 
- How have you been feeling about yourself and your abilities since you started researching these programs?
- What is it about studying environmental science that excites you, and what are your hopes for pursuing this field?

Understanding the client's current emotional state and motivations will help me gauge the level of distress they're experiencing and what drives their interest in pursuing a graduate program.

2. **Past experiences and their impact on self-perception**
Prompting Questions:
- You mentioned that school made you feel stupid, and you struggled with research, writing, and presentations. Can you think of any specific instances that stood out to you as particularly challenging or discouraging?
- How do you think these experiences have shaped your perception of yourself and your abilities?
- Are there any areas where you felt more confident or capable in your academic or personal life?

Exploring the client's past experiences will help me understand how these events have contributed to their current self-doubt and perceived limitations.

3. **Concrete goals and expectations for graduate studies**
Prompting Questions:
- What are your short-term and long-term goals for pursuing a graduate program in environmental science?
- What specific skills or knowledge do you hope to gain from this program, and how do you see yourself applying them in the future?
- Are there any particular aspects of graduate studies that you're most anxious or uncertain about?

Clarifying the client's goals and expectations will help me understand what they hope to achieve and what specific challenges they may face in pursuing their goals.","Here’s how I would structure my response as a therapist addressing this client’s concerns:  

1. **Current Emotional State and Impact on Functioning**  
   *(Priority: Highest – Understanding how this issue is affecting the client’s daily life and well-being helps gauge urgency and intervention needs.)*  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - *""You mentioned feeling discouraged—can you describe how intense that feeling is? For example, does it affect your motivation to apply, your sleep, or other parts of your life?""*  
   - *""When these thoughts about not being ‘good enough’ come up, how do you typically cope? Do you avoid working on applications altogether, or push through despite the stress?""*  

2. **History of Self-Perception and Past Experiences**  
   *(Priority: Medium – Identifying longstanding beliefs about capabilities helps uncover patterns that may reinforce discouragement.)*  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - *""You said school made you feel ‘stupid’—can you tell me about a specific time when that feeling was strongest? What happened?""*  
   - *""You mentioned group projects were hard because you felt you had nothing to contribute. Were there moments when you did contribute something valuable, even if small? How did that feel?""*  

3. **Goals, Values, and Contradictions**  
   *(Priority: Important but Exploratory – Clarifying why grad school matters to them can reveal motivation and potential cognitive distortions.)*  
   **Prompting Questions:**  
   - *""Even though this process is discouraging, what about environmental science excites you enough to consider grad school?""*  
   - *""If you could imagine a version of yourself who felt confident in research or presentations, what would that look like? What steps would that version have taken?""*  

This approach balances assessing distress, uncovering deeper beliefs, and aligning interventions with the client’s values. Let me know if you'd like to refine any part!","1. Type of information: Client's self-concept and self-esteem related to academic performance  
Prompting Questions:  
- “Can you tell me more about how you view your academic strengths and weaknesses?”  
- “Have you always felt this way about your academic abilities, or did something specific contribute to these beliefs?”  
- “When you describe yourself as ‘not good at research or writing,’ are there specific experiences that led you to feel this way?”

2. Type of information: Emotional impact and current mental state  
Prompting Questions:  
- “How do you feel when you think about applying to grad programs?”  
- “Do these feelings of discouragement affect other aspects of your life, like your sleep, motivation, or mood?”  
- “On a day-to-day basis, how intense are these emotions—would you say they’re occasional discouragement or more consistent feelings of hopelessness or anxiety?”

3. Type of information: Past experiences and coping strategies in academic or collaborative settings  
Prompting Questions:  
- “You mentioned struggling with group projects—can you share a specific example and how you handled it at the time?”  
- “What strategies, if any, have helped you manage feelings of self-doubt around school in the past?”  
- “Have there been times when you did feel capable or successful in academic settings, even if briefly?”

This structured information would help assess the depth of the client’s self-critical thoughts, evaluate the possibility of underlying mental health concerns such as low self-esteem or anxiety, and identify areas for therapeutic intervention or strengths to build upon.","# Information to Gather from Client
