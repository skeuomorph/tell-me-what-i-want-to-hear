It\\'s completely understandable to feel anxious about your safety, especially when there are legitimate concerns in your area. Here are some suggestions that might help:\\n\\n1. **Acknowledge and accept your feelings**: Recognize that your anxiety is a normal response to a perceived threat. Acknowledge your feelings, and remind yourself that it\\'s okay to feel scared or worried.\\n\\n2. **Practice relaxation techniques**: Regular relaxation practices can help calm your nervous system and reduce anxiety. Try techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided meditation. You can find many free resources online, such as apps like Headspace or Calm.\\n\\n3. **Reframe your thinking**: Challenge negative thoughts by reframing them in a more realistic and positive light. For example, instead of thinking \"I\\'m definitely going to get stabbed,\" try reframing it as \"I\\'m aware of the risks, but I\\'ve taken precautions and the chances are low.\"\\n\\n4. **Take practical precautions**: While it\\'s essential to acknowledge your anxiety, taking practical steps to ensure your safety can also help alleviate concerns. Avoid walking alone in isolated areas, stay aware of your surroundings, and keep your phone charged and accessible.\\n\\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to your friends and family about how you\\'re feeling. Sharing your concerns with others can help you feel more supported and less isolated. Consider joining a support group or talking to a therapist who can help you develop coping strategies.\\n\\n6. **Gradual exposure**: Gradually exposing yourself to the situations that trigger your anxiety can help you become more comfortable over time. Start with small steps, like taking short walks in a safe area, and gradually increase the duration and distance.\\n\\n7. **Consider professional help**: If your anxiety is severely impacting your daily life, consider seeking help from a mental health professional. They can help you develop a personalized plan to manage your anxiety and work through underlying issues.\\n\\n8. **Stay informed, but don\\'t obsess**: Stay up-to-date with local news and safety information, but avoid excessive exposure to sensationalized or disturbing content. This can exacerbate your anxiety and create a distorted perception of risk.\\n\\n9. **Focus on the present moment**: When you\\'re out in public, try to focus on the present moment and your surroundings. Mindfulness techniques can help you stay grounded and centered.\\n\\n10. **Remind yourself of your strengths**: Lastly, remind yourself that you\\'re capable and strong. You\\'ve navigated challenging situations before, and you can do so again.\\n\\nRemember, overcoming anxiety takes time, patience, and practice. Be gentle with yourself, and don\\'t hesitate to seek help when you need it.\\n\\nHow do you feel about trying some of these suggestions?

This doesn’t mean you’re \"overreacting,\" but it does mean you deserve tools to cope.\\n\\n### 2. **Small Exposure + Safety Planning**  \\n   If leaving the house feels overwhelming, try gradual exposure:  \\n   - Start with short trips (e.g., walking around the block at a quiet time of day) and slowly increase time/distance.  \\n   - Plan routes that feel safer (well-lit areas, busy streets) and share your location with a friend.  \\n   - Carry something that makes you feel secure (e.g., a phone charger, pepper spray if legal, or even keys in your hand as a distraction).  \\n\\n### 3. **Grounding Techniques for Panic**  \\n   When your heart races or thoughts spiral, try:  \\n   - **5-4-3-2-1 method**: Name 5 things you see, 4 you can touch, 3 you hear, 2 you smell, 1 you taste.  \\n   - **Box breathing**: Inhale for 4 sec, hold for 4, exhale for 4, pause for 4. Repeat.  \\n   - A mantra: \"I am safe right now. I can handle this moment.\"\\n\\n### 4. **Limit Trauma Input**  \\n   If you’re constantly hearing about local violence (news, social media, word of mouth), try to set boundaries. Trauma psychologist Robert Duff calls this \"the trauma of the unrelenting threat.\" Stay informed, but designate \"no news\" times to give your brain a break.\\n\\n### 5. **Talk to Someone**  \\n   - **Friends**: Could you share your fears with them? Even saying, \"I’ve been feeling on edge lately—can we stick to daytime hangouts?\" might relieve pressure.  \\n   - **Professional help**: A therapist (especially one trained in CBT or EMDR) can help process fear and reframe thoughts. If therapy isn’t accessible, look into anxiety workbooks (*The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook* by Bourne is a classic).  \\n\\n### 6. **Focus on What You Can Control**  \\n   - Learn basic self-defense (even free online tutorials can boost confidence).  \\n   - Join or start a neighborhood safety group (e.g., walking buddies, community alerts).  \\n   - Practice self-care after outings—reward yourself for facing fears, even if it felt hard.  \\n\\n### 7. **Consider Underlying Factors**  \\n   Anxiety can amplify when we’re already stressed. Are you sleeping enough? Eating regularly? Dehydration/low blood sugar can mimic anxiety symptoms.  \\n\\nIf your anxiety starts affecting daily functioning (skipping work/school, isolating long-term), please reach out to a doctor or mental health professional. You don’t have to white-knuckle through this alone.  \\n\\nWould you feel comfortable sharing what’s helped even a little so far? Even small steps (like listening to a podcast while walking) can build momentum. You’re already brave for reaching out. 💛'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Closed Source\n### ChatGPT","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# openai API test \n\n# gpt-4o-mini (during dev testing) has 8b\n# GPT-4o has 200b \n# ChatGPT-4o has ~ >200b as well, just prod version\n\n# response = openai_client.responses.create(\n#     model=\"gpt-4o-mini\", # taking conservative approach\n#     input=df['text'][0]\n# )\n\n# print(response.output_text)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-19T17:58:29.292870Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-19T17:58:29.293196Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-19T17:58:29.356248Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-19T17:58:29.293174Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-19T17:58:29.355362Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Function to get a single OpenAI response\ndef get_openai_response(model_name, input_text):\n    try:\n        response = openai_client.responses.create(\n            model=model_name,\n            input=input_text  \n        )\n        return response.output_text\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(f\"Error: {e}\")\n        return None\n\n# Function to process the entire DataFrame\ndef run_model_on_dataframe(model_name, df):\n    column_name = model_name\n    df.loc[:, column_name] = None\n\n    for i in tqdm(range(len(df)), desc=f\"Querying {model_name}\"):\n        input_text = df.at[i, 'text']  # Get a single row's text\n        df.at[i, column_name] = get_openai_response(model_name, input_text)\n\n        if i > 0 and i % 5 == 0:\n            time.sleep(1)\n\n    return df\n\nresult_df = run_model_on_dataframe(\"chatgpt-4o-latest\", result_df)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-21T19:53:31.262013Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-21T19:53:31.263074Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-21T19:55:56.813381Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-21T19:53:31.263039Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-21T19:55:56.812018Z"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"display_data","data":{"text/plain":"Querying chatgpt-4o-latest:   0%|          | 0/10 [00:00<?, ?it/s]","application/vnd.jupyter.widget-view+json":{"version_major":2,"version_minor":0,"model_id":"4b8c9f94cfa54e51a162034d20029f82"}},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":12},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result_df['chatgpt-4o-latest'][0]","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-21T19:56:45.226626Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-21T19:56:45.227003Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-21T19:56:45.235821Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-21T19:56:45.226979Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-21T19:56:45.234466Z"}},"outputs":[{"execution_count":13,"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":"'Hey, I’m really sorry to hear that you’ve been feeling this way — that sounds incredibly tough. You\\'re not alone in feeling anxious in today’s world, especially when real threats or news stories keep reinforcing those fears. What you\\'re describing — the racing heart, constant scanning for danger, and persistent worry about being harmed — sounds like a form of **hypervigilance**, often linked to anxiety, particularly when someone feels unsafe in their environment.\\n\\nFirst off, your emotions are **valid**. It\\'s understandable to feel anxious when you’re hearing (or seeing) more violence in your area. Our brains are wired to keep us safe — but when fear becomes persistent and overpowering, it starts to interfere with your quality of life, and that’s something absolutely worth addressing.\\n\\nHere are a few things that might help, step by step:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 💬 1. **Talk to someone — don’t carry this alone**\\nIf you haven’t already, consider speaking with a **therapist or mental health professional**. The level of anxiety you’re describing is something that therapy can really help with, like **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)** or **trauma-informed approaches**, which are effective for managing intrusive thoughts and intense fear.\\n\\nYou’re not weak for seeking help — you’re being strong by facing it.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🧠 2. **Distinguish real danger from perceived danger**\\nIt might help to write down:\\n- What triggers the anxiety most intensely\\n- What your anxious thoughts are predicting\\n- Whether those dangers have happened to *you*, or whether they are based on news, stories, or \"what ifs\"\\n\\nWhile violence might be happening in your area, it’s common for our brains to **amplify the risk** after hearing repeated reports, especially if we already feel vulnerable. Instead of seeing caution as protection, anxiety makes us feel under **constant threat**.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🧘 3. **Grounding and calming techniques (for when you go out)**\\nTry small tools that offer some relief in the moment:\\n- **Box breathing**: Inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 4, exhale for 4, hold for 4. Repeat.\\n- **5-4-3-2-1 Grounding**: Identify 5 things you can see, 4 you can touch, 3 you can hear, 2 you can smell, 1 you can taste.\\n- Carry something comforting — a small object, bracelet, or note — that reminds you that *you are safe in this moment*.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 🧍 4. **Safety planning, not fear-fueled isolation**\\nIt’s okay to take steps to feel safer, such as:\\n- Avoiding high-risk areas at night\\n- Walking with friends when possible\\n- Taking different routes home\\n- Carrying a personal safety alarm or phone tracker\\n\\nBut the goal is to create **measured actions**, not live completely inside the anxiety. Avoiding everything decreases fear only **short-term**, but long-term it feeds the cycle. You\\'re already noticing this in how it\\'s affecting your ability to enjoy time with friends.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 👥 5. **Let someone you trust know how you’re feeling**\\nPick one or two people you trust and share what you’re going through. You don’t have to go into all the details all at once, but even saying, “Hey, I’ve been struggling with anxiety when I go out” can build a lifeline. It also makes it easier to have someone to call or talk to if you need support before or during outings.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### 💡 Remember:\\n> Being cautious is healthy. Being paralyzed by fear isn’t.  \\n> You deserve to feel safe in your body, and in your daily life.\\n\\nYou’re not broken — your mind is trying to protect you in overdrive, and it just needs help learning how to feel safe again.\\n\\nIf you\\'d like, I can help you find resources or therapists in your area, or walk you through some exercises you can practice. You don’t have to go through this on your own. ❤️\\n\\nDo you want to talk more about what specifically triggers it for you when you go out — like busy streets, hearing certain things, or particular locations?'"},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":13},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Usage Tracking\n# import requests\n# from datetime import datetime\n\n# org_id = None \n\n# start_time = int(datetime(2025, 5, 18).timestamp())\n\n# url = f\"https://api.openai.com/v1/organization/costs?start_time={start_time}&limit=1\"\n\n# headers = {\n#     \"Authorization\": f\"Bearer {openai_key}\",\n#     \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\"\n# }\n\n# if org_id:\n#     headers[\"OpenAI-Organization\"] = org_id\n\n# response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)\n\n# if response.ok:\n#     print(response.json())\n# else:\n#     print(f\"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}\")","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-19T01:27:46.356427Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-19T01:27:46.357044Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-19T01:27:47.036277Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-19T01:27:46.357023Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-19T01:27:47.035606Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Claude","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Anthropic API test \n\n# claude-3-haiku-20240307 has 8b - most cheap\n# claude-3-5-haiku-20241022 has 12b - second cheapest\n# claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022 has 70b - second most expensive\n# claude-3-7-sonnet-20250219 has 175b - second most expensive\n# claude-3-opus-20240229 has 200b - most expensive\n\n# message = anthropic_client.messages.create(\n#     model=\"claude-3-haiku-20240307\", # taking conservative approach\n#     max_tokens=1000,\n#     temperature=1,\n#     #system=\"You are a world-class poet.

Living with that kind of fear can be really isolating and exhausting.  What you're describing sounds like it could be symptoms of anxiety that might benefit from professional support. A therapist or counselor could help you develop coping strategies for managing these feelings when they arise.  In the meantime, some approaches that might help include: - Gradually exposing yourself to going outside, perhaps starting with short trips - Practicing grounding techniques when you feel anxious (deep breathing, naming things you can see/hear/feel) - Challenging catastrophic thoughts by examining actual probabilities - Being honest with friends about what you're experiencing  Would it be possible for you to speak with a healthcare provider about these feelings? They could assess whether this might be an anxiety condition that could benefit from treatment.  Remember that while your concerns about safety aren't irrational given what you've heard about your area, when anxiety significantly impacts your quality of life, it's worth seeking support.\""},"metadata":{}}],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"result_df.to_csv('experiment_4_results.csv')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-21T20:02:19.913021Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-21T20:02:19.915053Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-21T20:02:19.935871Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-21T20:02:19.914993Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-21T20:02:19.934246Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":22},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# No cost endpoint to track Anthropic API usage.
