    "* Dimensions: The chart displays 10 value dimensions arranged in a circle, each representing a fundamental human value according to Schwartz's theory of basic values: Self-Direction, Power, Universalism, Achievement, Security, Stimulation, Conformity, Tradition, Hedonism, and Benevolence.\n",

    "* Power: Both models score relatively low, but DeepSeek appears to score slightly higher\n",
    "* Universalism: Llama3.1 seems to place more importance on values related to understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and nature\n",
    "* Security and Conformity: Llama3.1 shows stronger preference for safety, harmony, and stability of society\n",
    "* Stimulation and Tradition: Both models score somewhat similarly in these dimensions\n",

    "The larger the overall area covered by a model's shape, the more intensely it endorses values in general. From this chart, Llama3.1 (blue) appears to have stronger value commitments overall, especially in Self-Direction and Universalism."
