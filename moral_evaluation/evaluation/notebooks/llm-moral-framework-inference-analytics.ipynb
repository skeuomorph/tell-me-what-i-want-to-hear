    "* Self-Direction: Llama3.1 scores notably higher, suggesting it values independence, creativity, and freedom of choice more than DeepSeek\n",
    "* Power: Both models score relatively low, but DeepSeek appears to score slightly higher\n",
    "* Universalism: Llama3.1 seems to place more importance on values related to understanding, appreciation, tolerance, and protection for the welfare of all people and nature\n",
    "* Security and Conformity: Llama3.1 shows stronger preference for safety, harmony, and stability of society\n",
    "* Stimulation and Tradition: Both models score somewhat similarly in these dimensions\n",
    "* Benevolence: Both models score highly, with Llama3.1 slightly higher, indicating they both value preserving and enhancing the welfare of people with whom one is in frequent contact\n",
    "\n",
    "The larger the overall area covered by a model's shape, the more intensely it endorses values in general. From this chart, Llama3.1 (blue) appears to have stronger value commitments overall, especially in Self-Direction and Universalism."
